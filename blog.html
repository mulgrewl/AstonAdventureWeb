        <h2> The start of our adventure!</h2>
        <h5>03/12/2018</h5>
        <p> When thinking about ideas for an adventure game, the first thing that came to our minds was the idea of mazes, challenges and achievements. By brainstorming for different adventure game ideas, we put ourselves in the position of the end-user, who in this case was a university student. A student’s experience of starting university can be very frightening, scary and challenging but at the same time it can elude feelings of excitement, joy and a sense of freedom. As a group of master’s students that originate from different backgrounds, it made it relatively easy for us to relate to the university students and the entire journey from being a fresher to a graduate. By thinking about what new students feel when joining the university, our plan was to provide students with an insight on the university journey. We utilised the Software Development Life-cycle to ensure that we follow a step by step approach to creating an exciting and innovative game – Aston Adventure.
</p>
<p>From planning, designing, Implementation and Testing our team is working hard to create an adventure game that students can play before joining Aston University. This is a fun way to experience going through Fresher’s fair picking up items that provide energy, and getting to lectures on time!
</p>
<p>We have a team working on creating a website for our game and the user interface, the design team that is responsible in creating the software architecture designing the sprites, implementing the sprites into the game and those testing the game.
</p>
<p>We are excited for to launch the second iteration of our game whereby users will be able to identify the look of the university and make their way around campus!
